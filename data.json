Consequently, a valuation of private property taken for public use is invalid if it relies solely on the tax assessment value found in tax declarations without considering other essential factors like acquisition cost, current market data, and BIR zonal valuations,.","facts": "Arellano University filed a complaint against the City Government of Pasay for taking its 805-square-meter property and converting it into a public street (Menlo Street) without expropriation proceedings or payment of just compensation. The City admitted the taking but disputed the valuation, leading to an appraisal report by City officials that pegged the value at P200.00 per square meter based solely on the 1978 City Assessor’s tax valuation as the time of taking,. The Regional Trial Court adopted this tax-based valuation with interest, but the Court of Appeals remanded the case for re-determination, ruling that the computation was based on incomplete data by relying only on the 1978 tax assessment without considering other factors like BIR zonal valuations and acquisition cost,.","issue": "Whether the determination of just compensation based solely on the tax assessment value provided by the City Assessor is valid.","ruling": "NO, the valuation based solely on tax assessment is not valid. Under the principle established in Export Processing Zone Authority v. Judge Dulay, tax values serve only as guides and cannot be absolute substitutes for just compensation, as the 'justness' of the amount is a judicial function requiring a consideration of the 'totality of circumstances' beyond mere tax declarations,. Here, the trial court and commissioners erred by relying exclusively on the 1978 tax assessment revision without considering other mandatory factors such as BIR zonal valuations, acquisition cost, and the property's potential uses. Hence, the case must be remanded for a proper determination of fair market value using complete data beyond mere tax assessments.","dispositive": "ACCORDINGLY, the petition is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The December 28, 2020 Decision and the March 15, 2021 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 113233 are MODIFIED, in that: 1) the award of exemplary damages is DELETED; and 2) the interest on the value of the property at the time of taking shall likewise earn interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of finality of this Decision until full payment."}},
"002": {"digest": {"grNo": "273446 & 273493","doctrine": "Banks are mandated by law to observe prudence and diligence higher than that of a good father of a family owing to the fiduciary nature of their business, and the possession of a certificate of time deposit serves as a key indication that payment has not yet been made since banks typically require its surrender upon redemption. Consequently, the bank is held liable for the value of the time deposits because the depositors retained the original certificates, and the bank failed to exercise the required diligence by relying on a demand draft allegedly signed by the depositor at a time when she was scientifically and officially proven to be out of the country.","facts": "Remedios and Angelita Antonino invested in time deposits with BDO San Lorenzo, receiving Time Deposit Certificates (TDCs) which stipulated surrender upon redemption, but upon attempting to withdraw the funds years later after the branch closed, BDO refused, claiming the funds were already redeemed in 2001 via a Demand Draft signed by Angelita. The Antoninos filed a suit for collection, presenting the original TDCs and proof from the Bureau of Immigration and Angelita's passport that she was in the United States when the alleged redemption occurred, while BDO relied on computer history data and the disputed Demand Draft. The Regional Trial Court ruled in favor of the Antoninos, ordering BDO to pay the principal plus damages. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision in toto, ruling that the Antoninos evidence was superior and that BDO was remiss in its duty of diligence.","issue": "Whether the Antoninos are entitled to recover the proceeds of their time deposits despite the bank's claim of prior payment.","ruling": "YES, they are entitled to recover the proceeds. Under established jurisprudence, the burden of proof shifts to the defendant to establish its defense once the plaintiff proves their case, and possession of a time deposit certificate is substantial evidence that the deposit remains unpaid. Here, the Antoninos presented the original TDCs which the bank required to be surrendered upon redemption, while the bank's evidence of a signed Demand Draft was rebutted by official records proving Angelita was abroad on the alleged date of signing. Hence, the bank is liable for the deposits and damages for failing to exercise the highest degree of diligence required of banking institutions.","dispositive": "ACCORDINGLY, the Petitions for Review on Certiorari are DENIED. The assailed Decision dated September 29, 2023 and the Resolution dated April 22, 2024 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. C.V No. 116100 are hereby AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION.

Consequently, the candidates representation of residency in a new locality while actively serving as mayor in another constitutes a deliberate false material representation, rendering the certificate of candidacy invalid for failure to meet the one-year residency requirement due to the lack of intent to abandon the old domicile.","facts": "Pax Ali, while serving as the incumbent Mayor of Datu Abdullah Sangki, Maguindanao, filed his certificate of candidacy for Governor of Sultan Kudarat, declaring that he had re-established his domicile in the latter province for one year and eight months prior to the election. Private respondents filed petitions to cancel his certificate, arguing that his incumbency as Mayor negated his claim of residency in Sultan Kudarat, to which Pax Ali countered that he had physically moved and subsequently resigned as Mayor to prove his intent to abandon his former residence. The Commission on Elections First Division cancelled his certificate of candidacy for false material representation regarding his residency qualification, and the Commission En Banc affirmed this decision, ruling that his continued discharge of duties as Mayor precluded him from validly acquiring a new domicile of choice in Sultan Kudarat.","issue": "1. Whether the Commission on Elections committed grave abuse of discretion in cancelling the certificate of candidacy on the ground of false material representation regarding residency qualification.\n2. Whether the rule on succession applies in filling the vacancy caused by the cancellation of the winning candidates certificate of candidacy.","ruling": "1. NO, the Commission did not commit grave abuse of discretion. Under the Local Government Code, an elective official must be a resident of the locality where they intend to be elected for at least one year, and domicile requires physical presence, intent to remain, and intent to abandon the old domicile. Here, the candidates continued incumbency as Mayor of another municipality negated the intent to abandon that domicile, meaning the new residency could only be reckoned from the date of resignation which fell short of the statutory requirement. Hence, the declaration of eligibility constituted a deliberate false material representation warranting the cancellation of the certificate of candidacy.\n2. YES, the rule on succession applies. The Supreme Court abandoned the second placer rule, holding that it lacks legal basis and is repugnant to the will of the electorate, thereby mandating the application of the rules on succession under Section 44 of the Local Government Code. Here, the cancellation of the winning candidates certificate created a permanent vacancy in the gubernatorial office because he failed to qualify. Hence, the duly elected Vice-Governor shall succeed as Governor.","dispositive": "ACCORDINGLY, the Petition is DISMISSED. The Resolution dated January 18, 2022 of the COMELEC First Division and the Resolution dated May 2, 2022 of the COMELEC En Banc in SPA No. 21-078 (DC) and SPA No. 21-114 (DC) are AFFIRMED. Petitioner Datu Pax Ali S. Mangudadatu is ORDERED to cease and desist from discharging the functions of the Office of the Governor of Sultan Kudarat and to surrender the same to the duly elected Vice-Governor of the province in the May 9, 2022 elections.
